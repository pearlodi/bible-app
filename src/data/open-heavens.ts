      "But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved) Ephesians 2:4-5",
    read: "2 Samuel 6:14-16",
    message: `
  Many of God’s attributes can be seen in the Bible and one of them is that He is merciful. Today’s memory verse says that He is rich in mercy, and this means that He has more than enough for everyone; hence, He can never run out of it. The Bible also says in Psalm 62:12:<br /><br />
  
  <i>Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy…</i><br /><br />
  
  The Scripture above tells us that mercy belongs to God. When something belongs to someone who loves you, you can rest assured that he or she will give you that thing anytime you need it. This means that as long as you belong to God, you will always enjoy His mercy. Today’s Bible reading tells the story of a leper who came to Jesus and said, “If you will, you can make me clean.” In other words, he was saying, “I know you are merciful, but I don’t know if that mercy extends to me. If you will have mercy on me, then I know I will become clean.” Jesus didn’t get angry at him; He reached out to him and touched him.<br /><br />
  
  In those days, it was forbidden to touch a leper, but when mercy shows up for a man, it breaks human protocols. Jesus also corrected the leper’s wrong mindset. He told him, “I will; be clean.” Jesus showed him that mercy is always available to those who come to Him. God never withholds His mercy from those who cry out to Him for it. When Blind Bartimaeus cried for mercy in Mark 10:46-52, Jesus heard his cry and responded. When a father cried for mercy concerning his son who was tormented by a devil, Jesus responded and delivered the child (Matthew 17:14-18).<br /><br />
  
  When the Canaanite woman cried for mercy concerning her daughter, even though it wasn’t yet time for the Gentiles to experience God’s merciful gift of salvation, Jesus responded, and the girl was made whole (Matthew 15:22-28).<br /><br />
  
  In the name above every other name, I pray that God’s mercy will locate you and make you whole in all areas of life. God’s mercy is great. Psalm 57:10 tells us that His mercy is great unto the heavens. However, as great as God’s mercy is, it is only available to those who genuinely repent of their sins, surrender their lives to Jesus, and make a commitment to living a holy life. Only those who fear God will partake of His overflowing mercy (Psalm 103:11).

      "Praise ye the LORD: for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely. Psalms 147:1",

  In today’s Bible reading, David praised God with all his might and danced with total abandon. This is a classic example of <b>overflowing praise</b>; no wonder God blessed Him beyond measure. When we overflow with praise towards God, He gives us blessings that are beyond measure. When you praise God, you please Him, and when you please Him, He makes even your enemies to be at peace with you (Proverbs 16:7). No wonder David never lost a battle; his overflowing praise always made God silence all his enemies before him.<br /><br />
  
  When you go out of your way to praise God, He goes out of His way to shower you with abundant blessings. To really give overflowing praise to God, you cannot set limits to your praise; you have to praise Him without ceasing. This means that you keep praising Him everywhere you go and while going about your daily activities. This also means that your major preoccupation throughout all your days should be to give Him praise continually. This is why every time people see me, they notice that my mouth is always moving – I am always singing choruses to praise my God.<br /><br />
  
  I remember one time I travelled outside Nigeria; I went to a bookstore to buy some books. While picking the books, I was singing praises to God. A white man came into the bookstore, saw me, and made a joke about my singing. We laughed, shook hands, and as he was about to leave, he said, “Wait a minute, it is gone!” Apparently, he had been suffering from a backache for years. The moment I shook his hands in that mood of worship, the backache disappeared. If you want to experience constant miracles everywhere you go, even when you are not expecting it, then you should be giving God overflowing praise.<br /><br />
  
  Those who give God overflowing praise do not wait for Him to do anything for them before they praise Him. They praise Him in season and out of season. Just the fact that they get up from their beds in the morning is enough reason to give Him praise. In return, God ensures that He meets their needs even before they ask so that they can put more time and focus into praising Him. Before any trouble comes, He settles it so that the flow of praise does not stop.<br /><br />
  
  Beloved, make it a habit to praise God everywhere you go, and He will beautify your life with His abundant blessings.

      "Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth. 3 John 2",
    read: "Genesis 3:1-19",
    message: `
  <b>God’s will</b> is not just for us to be healthy but to overflow with health. You can be so healthy that when sick people touch you, they will become healed. The Lord Jesus was overflowing with health, which is why the woman with the issue of blood simply touched the hem of His garment and was healed (Matthew 9:20-22).<br /><br />
  
  Years ago, a teenager who had sickle cell anaemia and had been sick all his life stood up to give a testimony in church. He said, “I heard that Daddy G.O. is coming to this church next Sunday. I want to testify that I will be healed next Sunday.” Somebody called me to tell me the teenager’s testimony, and I started praying that God would allow me to meet him. As God would have it, the young man was standing outside as I got to the church and came out of my car. He didn’t look like a teenager at all; he looked so tiny. He came to me and said,<br /><br />
  
  “Daddy, I’ve been sick all my life, but I am confident that since you have come to this church today, I will be healed today.” I hugged him and said, “It will be unto you according to your faith.” I got his letter some months later, and he wrote, “Dear Daddy, I want to thank God, and I want to thank you. I have been healed since the day you came to our church.”<br /><br />
  
  Beloved, Jesus didn’t just die for you to be healthy; He wants your health to overflow such that any sick person you lay hands on will become healed and healthy. He said in Mark 16:17-18:<br /><br />
  
  <i>And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;<br />
  They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them;<br />
  they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.</i><br /><br />
  
  In 1 Peter 2:24, the Bible says that Jesus paid for your health; this is why you must hate sicknesses and diseases passionately. Just as Peter’s shadow healed the sick (Acts 5:15) and handkerchiefs taken from Paul’s body drove out diseases from people (Acts 19:12), God wants you to overflow with health and become a channel of healing and health to others.<br /><br />
  
  I pray that you will live in constant health all the days of your life and that the healing anointing will flow through you to others, in Jesus’ name.
